Description: The hsv package offers easy front-end to handle
	avi video files through FFmpeg software.
	The functions were originally created for personal uses
	of the author and (mainly) my colleagues to analyze
	high-speed videos recorded in our experiments.
	(Thus this package has nothing to do with
	Hue-Saturation-Lightness color space,
	nor Herpes Simplex Virus.)
	Of course, the package can also be used in handling normal videos.
	Although the package is still under the construction and testing,
	it is already usable and thus the author decided to publish it open.
	Since hsv package is correctly a mere front-end to ffmpeg.exe,
	installation of FFmpeg software is mandatory
	before using this package.
